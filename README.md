# OpenGL-4D-Graph-Extension
  This C++OpenGL application uses 3D slicing and 3D projection wireframe methods to visualize various scenes in four-dimensional physical space, such as walls, terrain, water bodies, lights, dynamic physical rigid bodies, particles, dynamic sky boxes, and simple decorations. These scenes include the calculation of various texture maps, four-dimensional normals, and the use of a built-in CPU four-dimensional physics engine, allowing players to rotate, walk, and run freely, Jumping and flying to explore scenes can interact with objects such as dynamic physical rigid bodies, as well as basic editing functions such as building, controlling, modifying, and deleting 4d objects.

## Features
Rotate and move players to observe the scene

Control and drag dynamic rigid bodies

Terrain coloring

Building and deleting objects

## Controling
WASDRF：players move forward, backward, left, and right ana kata

Space：jump

Double press Space: fly or land

Double press W: run

Move the mouse: move the player's perspective within a three-dimensional plane

Left click on the mouse: move the player's perspective and move the 3D section

In control mode

Press Right click :drag an object

Left and right mouse buttons :throw objects

In other modes

Right click on the mouse :execute the corresponding behavior

I: turn on or off the UI

C: Turn on or off the world coordinate system lines

G: Show or turn off wireframe

M/N:Zoom in and out of perspective
